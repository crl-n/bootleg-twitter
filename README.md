# bootleg-twitter
A WIP Twitter clone made with Spring Boot for a course in web server development at University of Helsinki during summer 2021. 

### How to run
Run the project in the Java IDE of your choice using MyApplication.java as the main class. The server should start and once it is up and running, you may connect to it using any browser. Browse to `localhost:8080` to find the web application.
